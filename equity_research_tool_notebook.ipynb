    "Writers, marketers, and designers are using AI tools to generate blogs, advertisements, video scripts, and social media posts at scale. This speeds up production and reduces costs but raises concerns about authenticity and originality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Software Development\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-powered code assistants help developers autocomplete functions, detect bugs, and write documentation. These tools boost productivity, especially for routine coding tasks, and reduce the entry barrier for new programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Education and Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Students and educators are using AI to create personalized learning content, quizzes, and explanations. AI tutors can simulate one-on-one interactions, offering explanations in multiple styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Customer Support and Virtual Assistants\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots driven by generative AI now handle customer queries with near-human fluency. From handling FAQs to simulating empathy, these systems are redefining customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Design and Product Development\n",
    "\n",
    "From architecture to industrial design, AI tools help professionals visualize and prototype products in minutes, automating early stages of ideation and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opportunities: Efficiency, Innovation, and Democratization\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantage of generative AI lies in its ability to **augment human capabilities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Speed and Scale:** Tasks that used to take days — such as writing reports or designing logos — can now be done in seconds.\n",
    "* **Accessibility:** Non-experts can create content or applications without deep technical knowledge.\n",
    "* **Innovation:** New artistic forms, personalized content, and novel solutions to problems are emerging thanks to generative creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses that adopt generative AI responsibly can unlock **higher productivity**, **cost savings**, and **creative breakthroughs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges and Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "With great power comes great responsibility — and significant challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Job Displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation of routine writing, coding, and design tasks raises fears of **job loss**, especially in entry-level roles. The World Economic Forum predicts that while 97 million new roles may emerge from AI, many existing ones could become obsolete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Misinformation and Deepfakes\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI can produce fake news, impersonate voices, or generate fake images and videos, leading to **trust issues** and potential misuse in politics, fraud, and harassment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Intellectual Property and Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "Content generated by AI often mimics training data, raising **legal concerns** around copyright infringement. Who owns AI-generated content — the user, the developer, or the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Bias and Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models trained on biased data can reinforce stereotypes or produce discriminatory outputs, especially in sensitive areas like hiring, finance, or healthcare.\n",
    "\n",

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:'), llm=ChatGroq(client=<groq.resources.chat.completions.Completions object at 0x0000026A217A2AD0>, async_client=<groq.resources.chat.completions.AsyncCompletions object at 0x0000026A217A34D0>, model_name='llama-3.1-8b-instant', model_kwargs={}, groq_api_key=SecretStr('**********')), output_parser=StrOutputParser(), llm_kwargs={}), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'source'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='Content: {page_content}\\nSource: {source}'), document_variable_name='summaries')), document_variable_name='context'), retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'HuggingFaceEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x0000026A218742B0>, search_kwargs={}))"

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: Is visa suspension for students in US permanent?\\n=========\\nContent: The relevant text is:\\n\\nLast week, the administration revoked Harvard University’s ability to enrol international students by removing it from the programme that allows US schools to sponsor foreign students for visas. \\n\\nThis text suggests that the visa suspension is not permanent because it mentions that the decision was \\\"quickly challenged in court and is currently blocked by a federal judge\\\".\\nSource: https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-stops-scheduling-visa-appointments-for-foreign-students-amid-plans-of-social-media-screening-13892311.html\\n\\nContent: A cable signed by Rubio and obtained by AP stated: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consulate sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor visa appointment capacity” until formal guidance is issued.\\n\\nWhen asked about the move at a press briefing, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said, “We will continue to use every tool we can to assess who it is that’s coming here, whether they are students or otherwise.”\\n\\nFirst reported by Politico, the move is the latest in the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown on international students.\\n\\nNote: However, there is no direct information in the provided text to state if the visa suspension is permanent.
